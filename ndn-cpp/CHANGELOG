NDN-CPP v0.7 (2015-05-13)
-------------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2624 By default, throw an exception when
  using the deprecated NDNx and binary XML wire format. To enable support while
  you upgrade your code to use NFD, in your main application set
  WireFormat::ENABLE_NDNX = true
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2388 Moved example programs from "tests" to "examples".
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1921 In Face, added getMaxNdnPacketSize().
  expressInterest and putData throw an exception if the encoded packet size exceeds it.
* Renamed KEY_TYPE_EC to KEY_TYPE_ECDSA.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2566 In Face, added setInterestFilter. In
  registerPrefix, make the onInterest callback optional.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2579 Added callback type OnInterestCallback
  to use in registerPrefix and setInterestFilter instead of OnInterest. The new
  callback is passed the Face so that you can supply the Data with face.putData().
* Face: Changed the OnInterest callback to pass interestFilterId instead of registeredPrefixId.
  (You should use OnInterestCallback instead of the deprecated OnInterest.)
* MemoryContentCache: In registerPrefix, changed the onDataNotFound to OnInterestCallback.
  If your application uses onDataNotFound, you must update your callback function.
* In KeyChain::createIdentity, added an optional KeyParams argument.
* In Interest setter methods, return this so that you can chain calls to update values.
* In configure, only link to the Boost regex library if HAVE_STD_REGEX==0.
* Added class util/SegmentFetcher, ported from ndn-cxx. Use it in examples test-list-rib.
* Added the public NDN-CPP Lite API in include/ndn-cpp/lite. See README-NDN-CPP-Lite.md.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2532#change-8836 In Face.registerPrefix,
  if connected to a remote NFD then use localhop to do remote registration. (For
  remote registration, the remote NFD must be configured for localhop_security.)
  Added the optional method Face.isLocal() for the application to check if the
  connection is local.
* In MemoryContentCache, added support for storePendingInterest. add(data) will
  check if the added Data packet satisfies any pending interest. You can use
  getStorePendingInterest() for onDataNotFound in registerPrefix().
* In ControlParameters, added support for Uri and Strategy.
* In TlvWireFormat, implemented decodeControlParameters.
* examples: Added test-list-channels, test-list-faces, test-list-rib and
  test-register-route to query NFD.
* examples: In repo-ng added basic-insertion and watched-insertion to show
  interaction with the repo-ng repository.
* examples: Added arduino/analog-reading-consumer.cpp and the related
  Arduino sketch examples/arduino/analog-reading.
* examples: Make test-encode-decode-benchmarks use NDN-CPP Lite to test C.
* examples: Removed test-encode-decode-forwarding-entry and
  test-publish-async-ndnx because NDNx support is deprecated.
* Unit tests: Added test-der-encode-decode tests for CertificateExtension.
* Unit tests: In test-interest-methods, added ExcludeMatches.

Deprecated
* Deprecated support for NDNx and binary XML. See WireFormat::ENABLE_NDNX above.
* In Face, deprecated registerPrefix where onInterest is type OnInterest. Use the
  registerPrefix where onInterest is OnInterestCallback so you can call face.putData().

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2758 ControlParameters with empty name not properly encoded.

NDN-CPP v0.6 (2014-12-23)
-------------------------

Changes
* In MetaInfo, added get/setFinalBlockId (replaces the deprecated get/setFinalBlockID).
* In Name, added wireEncode and wireDecode.
* In MemoryContentCache, added unregisterAll.
* Added Sha256WithEcdsaSignature. Support encoding/decoding it in interests and data packets.
* Added DigestSha256Signature. Support encoding/decoding it in interests and data packets.
* In KeyChain, added generateEcdsaKeyPair and generateEcdsaKeyPairAsDefault.
* In KeyChain, added signWithSha256.
* Unit tests: In test-name-methods, fixed bug for "make check" on Ubuntu.
* Unit tests: Added test-name-conventions.
* Unit tests: Added test-verification-rules to test NdnRegexMatcher.
* Unit tests: In test-data-methods, added VerifyEcdsa and VerifyDigestSha256.
* Unit tests: In test-interest-methods, added VerifyDigestSha256.
* Unit tests: In test-identity-methods, added EcdsaIdentity.

Deprecated
* In MetaInfo, deprecated get/setFinalBlockID. Use get/setFinalBlockId.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2083 Fix Name::append(string) calls the URI Name(string) constructor.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2017 Support older versions of Protobuf.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2134 ChronoSync2013 shared_ptr for callbacks.
* In KeyChain::createIdentity, fix certificate's KeyLocator name to be certificateName.getPrefix(-1).

NDN-CPP v0.5 (2014-08-27)
-------------------------

Changes
* Changed ndn::toHex and Blob::toHex to output lower-case.
* In IdentityManager, added a default constructor to use the system storage.
* In the KeyChain constructor, if identityManager is omitted, use the system default IdentityManager.
* In the KeyChain constructor, if policyManager is omitted, use NoVerifyPolicyManager.
* In KeyChain, added verifyInterest.
* In BasicIdentityStorage, changed the SQL file to ~/.ndn/ndnsec-public-info.db .
* In the default Name::Component constructor, create a zero-length value, not null, to avoid null pointer problems.
* Renamed test-publish-async to test-publish-async-ndnx.
* Added test-publish-async-nfd.
* Renamed internal class Tlv1_0a2WireFormat to Tlv0_1WireFormat.
* COPYING: Changed the license to LGPLv3.
* Added encoding/ProtobufTlv for converting a Protobuf message object to TLV encoding.
* Added sync/ChronoSync2013 and the chat demo tests/test-chrono-chat. See:
  http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api/chrono-sync2013.html
* In test-encode-decode-data and test-encode-decode-benchmark, change the RSA test key to 2048 bits.
* Added UnixTransport. If using the default Face(), try to connect using a Unix socket.
* Added ./configure options --with-std-shared-ptr and --with-boost-shared-ptr. See ./configure --help .
* Added ./configure options --with-std-function and --with-boost-function. See ./configure --help .
* In Name.appendSegment and appendVersion, encode the number as nonNegativeInteger which is always 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
  This means that appendSegment(0) now encodes as %00%00 instead of just %00.
* In Name, added appendSegmentOffset, appendTimestamp and appendSequenceNumber.
* In Name.Component, added toSegmentOffset, toTimestamp and toSequenceNumber.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1847 If using std, put _1, _2, etc. in the func_lib namespace.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1738 Remove trailing whitespace

Deprecated
* In MemoryPrivateKeyStorage, deprecated setKeyPairForKeyName without an explicit keyType. Use
  setKeyPairForKeyName passing the explicit key type such as KEY_TYPE_RSA.

Bug fixes

* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1900 Fix compiling with ./configure option --enable-shared=no.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1924 Should encode non-negative integers 253 through 255 as one byte.
* For TLV packets over UDP, ignore packets starting with 0x80.
* Fix bug for registerPrefix with NDNx.
* Fix bug for encoding/decoding the TLV Interest PublisherPublicKeyLocator.

NDN-CPP v0.4 (2014-02-27)
-------------------------

This release uses NDN-TLV for the default wire format.

Changes
* Changed the default wire format to TlvWireFormat.
* In ./configure, added option --enable-binary-xml=yes to revert to Binary XML.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1249. Support TLV FinalBlockId.

Deprecated
* Name: Deprecated appendFinalSegment. Use MetaInfo.setFinalBlockID.
* Name::Component: Deprecated toFinalSegment. Use MetaInfo.getFinalBlockID.
* Sha256WithRsaSignature: get/setDigestAlgorithm as deprecated.  (This is
  implicit in the class Sha256WithRsaSignature.)
* MetaInfo: Deprecated get/setTimestampMilliseconds: Use the
  application-specific content to store a timestamp.

Bug fixes
* Name: Fix bug in append to explicitly make a Component to call append(Component).
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1247 Use new TLV type codes to not
  conflict with binary XML. Note:  Using this new code must be done at the same
  time as using the updated ndnd-tlv which uses the new type codes.

NDN-CPP v0.3 (2014-01-31)
-------------------------

Changes
* Added option for "./configure --enable-tlv=yes" to build with NDN-TLV as the default wire format.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1105 In Name, added comparison operators.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1085 In Name::Component, added comparison operators.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1086 In Name::getPrefix, support a negative argument, e.g. getPrefix(-1).
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1121 In Name::get, allow a negative index.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1089 Renamed key.hpp to key-locator.hpp .
* MetaInfo: Added setFinalBlockID for Name::Component, remove unused setFinalBlockID which take uint8_t*, etc.
* Moved class ExcludeEntry to inner class Exclude::Entry.
* In BinaryXmlDecoder, cache the result of peekDTag for a speedup when decoding optional elements.
* Moved validation-request.hpp to public API security/policy, and moved OnVerified and OnVerifyFailed in there.
* In Interest, added get/setMustBeFresh.
* In Interest, added keyLocator.  If the interest needs a publisher public key digest, the keyLocator type is
  ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST.
* In Interest, if any field is changed, clear the nonce.
* In MetaInfo, added get/setFreshnessPeriod.
* Changed ndn_ContentType_LINK and ndn_ContentType_KEY to the correct value for NDN-TLV.
* In Name, added experimental appendFinalSegment, and in Name::Component added toFinalSegment.
* Moved definitions for classes Exclude, Signature and MetaInfo to their own source code files.
* In autogen.sh, don't run ./configure since the user may want to run ./configure with options.

Deprecated
* Interest: Deprecated getAnswerOriginKind.  Use getMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated setAnswerOriginKind.  Use setMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated getPublicKeyLocator.  If the interest has a public key locator, its keyLocator has
  type ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and the key data has the digest.
* Interest: Deprecated constructors which take nonce and PublisherPublicKeyDigest.  If needed, use the constructor
  which takes a KeyLocator instead of the deprecated PublisherPublicKeyDigest.
* Interest: Deprecated setNonce.  You should let the wire encoder generate a random nonce internally.
* Sha256WithRsaSignature: Deprecated getPublicKeyLocator.  If the signature has a public key locator, its keyLocator has
  type ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and the key data has the digest.
* KeyLocator: Deprecated setKeyNameType.  If you need a publisher public key digest, set the keyLocatorType to
  ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and set the key data to the digest.
* KeyLocator: Deprecated getKeyNameType.  KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST is supported as a keyLocatorType.
* MetaInfo: Deprecated getFreshnessSeconds.  Use Milliseconds getFreshnessPeriod().
* MetaInfo: Deprecated setFreshnessSeconds.  Use setFreshnessPeriod(Milliseconds).
* Sha256WithRsaSignature: Deprecated get/setWitness.  Witness is deprecated.

Documentation
* Move instructions for running ./autogen.sh from configure.ac to the Development section of INSTALL.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1072: In Doxyfile, fix EXCLUDE for ndnboost to new location include/ndnboost .

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1056 Fix DTAG NDNProtocolDataUnit to encode as "NDN\202\000".
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1064 Add ax_lib_sqlite3.m4, etc. to m4 directory so that autogen.sh works out of the box.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1077 Move the BasicIdentityStorage sqlite file to ~/.ndnx/ndnsec-identity.db .
  NOTE: If you have an old file at ~/.ndn-identity/identity.db, please move it to ~/.ndnx/ndnsec-identity.db .
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1088 Certificate name in KeyLocator should not include the version number.
* Fix bug in getForwardingEntryFlags: Need to check all flags, not the first flag using "else if".
