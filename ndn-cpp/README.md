NDN-CPP:  A Named Data Networking client library for C++ and C
--------------------------------------------------------------

NDN-CPP is a new implementation of a Named Data Networking client library written in C++ and C.
It is wire format compatible with the new NDN-TLV encoding, with NDNx and PARC's CCNx.

NDN-CPP conforms to the NDN Common Client Libraries API and your application should
follow this public API:
http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api/ .
Further classes and methods are in the Doxygen-generated documentation.

See the file [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cpp/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for build and install instructions.

Please submit any bugs or issues to the NDN-CPP issue tracker:
http://redmine.named-data.net/projects/ndn-cpp/issues

---

The library currently requires a remote NDN daemon, and has been tested with:
* ndnd from NDNx: https://github.com/named-data/ndnx
* ndnd-tlv (which uses NDNx): https://github.com/named-data/ndnd-tlv
* The new NFD forwarder: https://github.com/named-data/NFD

Currently, the library has two APIs for developers:

	1. The C++ API which follows the NDN Common Client Library API also used by ndn-js (JavaScript)
     and PyNDN (Python). See http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api .

	2. A core C library implementing lower-level encoding and communication.  Applications should normally
     use the C++ API, but core C code will also function on embedded devices and other environments
     which don't have C++ support.
